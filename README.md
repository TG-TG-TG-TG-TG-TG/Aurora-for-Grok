# Aurora for Grok

A Chrome extension that wraps Grok on xAI with an ambient, glassy background plus ergonomic controls:

- Custom background presets, scaling, and blur with local file support
- Focus mode to collapse navigation and headers when writing
- Quick toggles to hide usage limits, SuperGrok upsells, and Imagine promos
- Lightweight settings popup and floating button (optional)

Aurora is an independent community project and is not affiliated with xAI.
